* ^purpose = "A flag is a warning or notification of some sort presented to the user - who may be a clinician or some other person involve in patient care. It usually represents something of sufficient significance to warrant a special display of some sort - rather than just a note in the resource. A flag has a subject representing the resource that will trigger its display.   \r\n\r\nThis subject can be of different types, as described in the examples below:   \r\n\r\n- A note that a patient has an overdue account, which the provider may wish to discuss with them - in case of hardship, for example (`subject = Patient`)   \r\n- An outbreak of Ebola in a particular region (`subject = Location`) so that all patients from that region have a higher risk of having that condition   \r\n- A particular provider is unavailable for referrals over a given period (`subject = Practitioner`)   \r\n- A patient who is enrolled in a clinical trial (`subject = Group`)   \r\n- Special guidance or caveats to be aware of when following a protocol (`subject = PlanDefinition`)   \r\n- Warnings about using a drug in a formulary requires special approval (`subject = Medication`)"
